Email
=====

This library is for processing e-mail. Currently it only sends messages via the SmtpClient class, but it could be modified to retrieve mail as well. It has primarily been used in ASP.NET web applications that need to send notifications and other messages to site users.

All its methods are static and it doesn't store any data. Most of the features of SmtpClient are exposed, such as the use of credentials, attachments, encoding, use of HTML, etc.
